##  📢 Annocement: I will be joining the Vanke School of Public Health at Tsinghua University as an Assistant Professor from Fall 2025.**

Research in my group will focus on leveraging ubiquitous sensing technologies to advance public health and develop novel AI tools for affordable, large-scale health screening. Our mission is to make healthcare accessible and inclusive—ensuring *no one is left behind*.

We welcome applications from prospective PhD students, Master’s candidates, and interns. Our lab collaborates closely with leading institutions, including the University of Cambridge, Oxford, and Harvard. Interested applicants should email me with their CV attached.

## 🎯 Bio

I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge, UK, where I got my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/). I received my master’s degree from the Department of Electronics and Engineering, Tsinghua University, China, in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/). Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Wuhan University, China, in 2017.

My research focuses on *human-centric data*, particularly sensory data that can be widely collected by mobile and wearable devices, with applications in public health, behavioral understanding, and urban management. Technologically, I specialize in 1) *data-efficient machine learning*, including self-supervised learning (SSL) foundation models and large language models (LLMs) ; 2) *trustworthy deep learning*, encompassing uncertainty quantification and privacy-preserving federated learning; and 3) *statistical methods*, such as clustering analysis, causal inference, and inequality discovery.  My passion lies in utilizing AI to build a better future—particularly in healthcare. I aspire for my research to enhance the efficiency, accessibility, and affordability of healthcare services worldwide.
