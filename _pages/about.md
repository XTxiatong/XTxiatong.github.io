I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, where my research has been focused on Reinforcement Learning. 

This year I have graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science, while also receiving the Best MPhil Student Award. Over the summer I interned at Google X, where I worked on Reinforcement Learning applied to robotics. Previously, I did my undergraduate at The University of Manchester in the UK with a dissertation on Text to Image Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks.
