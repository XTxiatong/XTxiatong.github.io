Hi there! My name is [Tong Xia](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/people.html), and I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge, UK, where I got my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/). I received my master’s degree from the Department of Electronics and Engineering, Tsinghua University, China, in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/). Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Wuhan University, China, in 2017.

My research span respiratory health, cardiovascular disease, urban health, pandemics, LLMs, foundation models, uncertainty quantification, federated learning, reinforcement learning, and causality.

I am deeply passionate about utilizing AI to build a better future, particularly in healthcare. I aspire for my research to enhance the efficiency, accessibility, and affordability of healthcare services.

My research focuses on leveraging data science and machine learning to advance healthcare applications. It spans two primary areas: (1) developing machine learning models for physiological data to enable intelligent precision medicine, and (2) analyzing and mining large-scale health data to improve public health outcomes at the population level.
