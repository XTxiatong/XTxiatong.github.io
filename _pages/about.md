I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). I am working on topological and geometric deep learning. 

In 2020 I interned at Google Brain. In 2019 I have graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge with a Best MPhil Student Award. That summer, I interned at Google X, where I worked 
on Reinforcement Learning as part of the [Everyday Robot Project](https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots). 
Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at The University of 
Manchester in the UK with an [award-winning](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/multiple-successes-for-manchester-undergrads-at-worlds-most-prestigious-student-awards/) dissertation on *Text to Image Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks* supervised 
by [Dr Jonathan Shapiro](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jls/). 

## News

- We released a new preprint: [Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Cellular: CW Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12575). We obtain SOTA results on molecular benchmarks. 
- I will be joining Twitter Research as a research intern in October 2021 to work on Topological & Geometric Deep Learning with [Michael Bronstein](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.bronstein) and his team. 
- [Deep Graph Mapper: Seeing Graphs through the Neural Lens](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2021.680535/full) has been accepted to Frontiers in Big Data as part of the [Topology in Real-World Machine Learning and Data Analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/14256/topology-in-real-world-machine-learning-and-data-analysis) research topic. 
- [Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Topological: Message Passing Simplicial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03212) was accepted as a short talk to ICML 2021. Previously, the paper was accepted as a spotlight presentation to the [Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning](https://gt-rl.github.io/) workshop at ICLR 2021. 
- Gave a talk with my co-authors on our [MPSN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03212) at the [Math Machine Learning seminar](https://www.mis.mpg.de/montufar/seminars/math-ml-seminar.html) organised by The Max Plank Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences and UCLA. A recording is available at [this link](https://media.mis.mpg.de/mml/2021-04-08/) and slides can be found [here](https://crisbodnar.github.io/files/mml_talk.pdf).
- [Neural ODE Processes](https://openreview.net/forum?id=27acGyyI1BY) was accepted as a poster to ICLR 2021. 
- I have been awarded the [Leathersellers' Graduate Scholarship](https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/college-life/fees-funding-and-awards/postgraduate-scholarships-and-prizes) by Fitzwilliam College and The Leathersellers' Company, one of the ancient Livery Companies of the City of London. The scholarship is awarded to four students each year for excellence in Physical or Biological Sciences, Engineering or Mathematics. 
- Our paper [On Second Order Behaviour in Augmented Neural ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07220) has been accepted at NeurIPS 2020.
