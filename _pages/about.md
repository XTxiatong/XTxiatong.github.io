>   Genuis only means hard-working all one’s life.\
> –Mendeleyev

Hi there! My name is Tong, and I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge, UK, where I got my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/). I received my master’s degree from the Department of Electronics and Engineering, Tsinghua University, China, in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/). Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Wuhan University, China, in 2017.

## Research

My research focuses on *human-centric time series data*, particularly sensory data that can be widely collected by mobile and wearable devices, with applications in public health, behavioral understanding, and urban management.

Technologically, I specialize in 1) *data-efficient machine learning*, including self-supervised learning (SSL) foundation models and large language models (LLMs) ; 2) *trustworthy deep learning*, encompassing uncertainty quantification and privacy-preserving federated learning; and 3) *statistical methods*, such as clustering analysis, causal inference, and inequality discovery.

I am deeply passionate about utilizing AI to build a better future, particularly in healthcare. I aspire for my research to enhance the efficiency, accessibility, and affordability of healthcare services.
