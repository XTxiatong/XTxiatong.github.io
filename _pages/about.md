I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). My research uses applied Topology and Differential Geometry for understanding and developing Geometric Deep Learning models with a focus on Graph Neural Networks. 

I am a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!people) (2021) and a former research intern at [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/) (2021), Google Brain (2020) and Google X (2019). In 2019, I have graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge with a Best MPhil Student Award. Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at The University of Manchester (UK) with an [award-winning](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/multiple-successes-for-manchester-undergrads-at-worlds-most-prestigious-student-awards/) research dissertation supervised 
by [Dr Jonathan Shapiro](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jls/). 

## News

- Feb 2022: New preprint - [Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Topological Perspective on Heterophily and Oversmoothing in GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04579). I will give a talk on the paper on the 8th of March at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/events/workshop-recent-advances-graph-machine-learning), followed by another talk on the 11th of March in the Department of Mathematics, University of Oxford.
