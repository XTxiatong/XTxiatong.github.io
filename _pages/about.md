I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). I am working on topological approaches to geometric deep learning.  

I am currently on a research internship at Twitter. I've previously interned at Google Brain (2020) and Google X (2019). In 2019, I have graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge with a Best MPhil Student Award. Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at The University of 
Manchester (UK) with an [award-winning](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/multiple-successes-for-manchester-undergrads-at-worlds-most-prestigious-student-awards/) dissertation on *Text to Image Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks* supervised 
by [Dr Jonathan Shapiro](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jls/).
