I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/).

In 2019 I have graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science, 
while also receiving the Best MPhil Student Award. Over the summer of 2019 I interned at Google X, where I worked 
on Reinforcement Learning as part of the [Everyday Robot Project](https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots). 
Previously, I did my undergraduate at The University of 
Manchester in the UK with a dissertation on Text to Image Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks supervised 
by [Dr Jonathan Shapiro](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jls/).
