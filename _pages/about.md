I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/).

This year I have graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science, 
while also receiving the Best MPhil Student Award. Over the summer I interned at Google X, where I worked 
on Reinforcement Learning applied to robotics. Previously, I did my undergraduate at The University of 
Manchester in the UK with a dissertation on Text to Image Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks supervised 
by [Dr Jonathan Shapiro](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jls/).
