I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). I am working on topological and geometric deep learning. 

In 2020 I interned at Google Brain. In 2019 I have graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge with a Best MPhil Student Award. That summer, I interned at Google X, where I worked 
on Reinforcement Learning as part of the [Everyday Robot Project](https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots). 
Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at The University of 
Manchester in the UK with an [award-winning](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/multiple-successes-for-manchester-undergrads-at-worlds-most-prestigious-student-awards/) dissertation on *Text to Image Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks* supervised 
by [Dr Jonathan Shapiro](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jls/). 

## News
